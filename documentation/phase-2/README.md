# Phase 2 Documentation

Phase 2 focuses on expanding the client management system beyond the core project/update workflow.
This folder centralizes planning artifacts for the upcoming feature cycle.

## Folder Structure

- `Feature-Backlog.md` — High-level briefs for every Phase 2 feature candidate.
- `Roadmap.md` — Milestones, sequencing, and dependency notes for implementation.
- `Technical-Considerations.md` — Architecture spikes, data model adjustments, and integration notes.
- `UX-Notes.md` — User stories, wireframe links, and interaction requirements.

## How to Use

1. Capture raw ideas in `Feature-Backlog.md` and tag them by priority.
2. When a feature is approved, outline delivery steps and owners in `Roadmap.md`.
3. Document schema changes, cross-service impacts, and performance concerns in `Technical-Considerations.md`.
4. Keep user journeys, edge cases, and accessibility requirements up to date in `UX-Notes.md`.

## Core Themes for Phase 2

- Deepen collaboration with real-time and asynchronous feedback loops.
- Improve client engagement by surfacing insights and notifications.
- Strengthen governance through auditing and advanced access controls.
- Enhance polish with brandable client views and richer content types.
